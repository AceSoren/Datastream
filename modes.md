* Shop menu lets you get more upgrades and remove Corruption
* You start with a random deck of 8 max single use per stage battle cards. Deck can be modified with purchased or earned cards. Boosters can be bought at the shop
* Fighter select is available per stage
* When playing online, other players that need rescue will show up on the map. Rank scales by how powerful their equipment is. Beating rescue stages will reward you with random copies of items from their inventory, high experience and full removal of corruption if at 50% or higher

* If you fail a rescue stage, you will get incapacitated instead of permadeath. Players online will get more rewards for the difficulty but be unable to loop the stage.
